# 3DOF_Platform
Dynamic systems 3 degrees of freedom platform. 

# Description
This porject consists of a Ardiuno code and a Python code for both MAC OS and Windows. The reasoning for the two different opertive versions are because of the port_id differences when connecting to arduino and differing arguments for the cv2.VideoCapture function. The project controls a rolling ball on a 3DOF platform using a state feedback controller. For platform motion, three servo motors are connected to a ardunio mictrocontroller, hence the arduino code. The python code uses multiprocessing and its queue system via the multiprocessing libraby. The code processes the servo control and ball tracking as well as the green line that showcases the different types of shapes of control. This caused an error where if putting the ball on the platform before fully running the program, the system would think the ball has infinite speed. The code also has a built in PID class that is not used as the controller, but developed for early test purposes. The state space controller mimics a PD controller since the states of the system are position and velocity. Control methods like LQR and state observer was also implemented and tested but gave worse results than the state feedback controller.
